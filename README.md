# SFUMATO SCSS

## Scalable web pages made easy.

*SFUMATO* is a lightweight SCSS framework for scalable viewport width-based responsive websites. This allows means intermediate screen widths just look right. Pages zoom until you get to the next breakpoint. For example, all phone views can be identical. It also allows you to have much more control over a **near pixel-perfect layout**.

As part of this framework a new **flexbox grid system** has been created, allowing you to easily structure page layouts much like traditional responsive grid systems. Why? Flexbox is more reliable and offers easy ways to do things like center column contents, make columns equal heights based on the tallest one, and more.
